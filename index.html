    Have you always wanted to learn the dance steps of the Kalamatianos, the Sirtos or the Chasaposervikos? 
    Or have you always wanted to join a group of dancing Greeks at a summer village festival, 
    but never had the courage? Or do you always say no when they spontaneously ask you to dance with 
    them on a seafront terrace, as soon as the music starts? 
    </p>
    <p>
    In that case you should certainly join the dance lessons. In small groups you will learn some of the most 
    popular traditional Greek dances. The lessons are for beginners and for slightly advanced dancers.
